abstract: "This study investigates the differential relationships between gesture use during pretend play and subsequent narrative development in children with and without early unilateral brain injury. We compare how representational versus non-representational gestures produced during naturalistic play at 59 months predict narrative structure complexity at ages 5-6 years across these populations. Drawing from a longitudinal sample of 20 typically developing children and 11 children with pre- or perinatal brain lesions, we analyze spontaneous parent-child interactions and structured narrative tasks to delineate potential compensatory pathways in language development. Whereas previous research has primarily focused on gesture as a unified construct, we distinguish between different gestural categories to identify specific mechanisms that may support complex language development. Our theoretical framework proposes that representational gestures during pretend play may provide a crucial scaffold for the development of narrative abilities, potentially serving as an alternative route to narrative competence for children with neurological vulnerabilities. By examining populations where typically unified developmental processes may become uncoupled, this research contributes to our understanding of how gestural abilities support complex language development and identifies potential intervention approaches that leverage children's natural compensatory strategies. The findings have implications for both theoretical models of the relationship between play, gesture, and narrative development, and practical approaches to supporting children with developmental vulnerabilities."

The relationship between play and child development has been extensively studied, with research documenting significant associations between play experiences and developmental outcomes. However, the specific mechanisms through which play supports development remain incompletely understood, particularly regarding how biological and environmental factors may moderate these relationships. 

Of the numerous types of play, pretend play—in which children operate simultaneously in real and imagined contexts—emerges as particularly significant for cognitive, linguistic and social development [@laiImpactPlayChild2018; @nicolopoulouNarrativePerformancePeer2014]. Recent theoretical and empirical work suggests that pretend play may serve crucial functions in developing abstract thinking, narrative abilities, and emotion regulation [@gleasonPretendPlayAbstraction2023; @lillardWhyChildrenPretend2017]. Pretend play involves multiple cognitive demands, including symbolic transformation, perspective-taking, and narrative construction. Each of these components may contribute differently to development, yet researchers have typically examined play as a unified construct rather than exploring its constituent elements [@lillardImpactPretendPlay2013; @lillardWhyChildrenPretend2017].

The role of gesture in early language development provides unique insight into how different representational abilities might support complex language skills. Children typically begin using meaningful gestures between 9 and 12 months, before they produce words, and these early gestures predict subsequent language milestones [@goldin-meadowActionAbstractionGesture2015; @iversonGesturePavesWay2005]. For instance, children's use of gesture-plus-word combinations (e.g., pointing to a cup while saying "drink") reliably predicts when they will begin producing two-word utterances. Additionally, recent research demonstrates that children's use of iconic gestures at age 5 predicts their ability to produce well-structured narratives in subsequent years [@demirTaleTwoHands2015]. This predictive relationship suggests that gesture may serve as a transitional device in language development, allowing children to practice expressing complex ideas through one modality before they can do so in another [@iversonGesturePavesWay2005; @soWhenSpeechAmbiguous2010].

Children with early unilateral brain injuries present a particularly informative case for understanding how gesture and play support development: while these children demonstrate remarkable plasticity in basic language functions, they show specific vulnerabilities in complex linguistic and cognitive tasks like narrative production [@demirNarrativeProcessingTypically2014; @demirNarrativeSkillChildren2010; @demirVocabularySyntaxNarrative2015]. These children produce narratives that are quantitatively and qualitatively different from those of typically developing peers, characterized by shorter length, less diverse vocabulary, and reduced structural complexity [@demirNarrativeSkillChildren2010]. However, it remains unclear whether these differences reflect specific deficits in narrative construction, broader challenges in symbolic thinking, or difficulties integrating multiple cognitive processes.

Research on gesture and narrative development provides insight into potential mechanisms. When viewing stories presented with co-speech gestures by a narrator, children with brain injuries show enhanced narrative retelling abilities compared to stories presented without gesture [@demirNarrativeProcessingTypically2014]. Similarly, these children show stronger benefits from gestural support in developing narrative skills compared to typically developing peers [@demirVocabularySyntaxNarrative2015]). These findings suggest that gestural supports may differentially impact developmental mechanisms across populations.

This differential impact becomes particularly relevant when considering different types of gestures. While previous research has focused primarily on iconic gestures that depict actions, objects, or spatial relationships, less attention has been paid to the broad category of representational gestures which includes iconic gestures as well as metaphoric gestures that depict abstract concepts and demonstrative gestures that show how actions are performed [@cooperriderWhenGestureBecomes2017; @hostetterWhenGesturesCommunicate2011]. Children with brain injuries often show particular sensitivity to gestures in narrative contexts, and the presence of gestures can significantly enhance their narrative performance [@demirNarrativeProcessingTypically2014]. Distinguishing between representational gestures (iconic, metaphoric, and demonstrative gestures that depict content) and non-representational gestures (such as beat gestures that emphasize rhythm of speech, or conventional gestures like thumbs up) may provide new insights into the specific gestural mechanisms that support narrative development.

# Current Study
The complex relationship between gesture, play and narrative development is difficult to disentangle when studying typically developing children alone, as these processes often develop in tandem. However, examining populations where these pathways may become uncoupled provides unique insight into how gestural processes support complex language development. Children with early unilateral brain injuries present such an opportunity - their selective pattern of preserved basic language skills but impaired complex narrative abilities allows us to examine how different types of gesture might support narrative development.
Pretend play provides an ideal context for this investigation, as it naturally elicits character viewpoint gesture through its decontextualized nature. Research has established that pretend play incorporates both narrative and gestural elements in ways that appear to scaffold the development of abstract thinking and symbolic representation [@gleasonPretendPlayAbstraction2023]. The quality of pretend play, particularly children's ability to engage in elaborate sequences and object substitutions, predicts later semantic and narrative abilities [@stagnittiQualityPreschoolChildrens2015].

Our research examines two key questions:

1. How do different types of gesture (representational vs. non-representational) manifest during pretend play in children with and without brain injury?

2. How do these early gestural patterns predict later narrative development?

Based on previous research, I hypothesized that the relationship between pretend play gestures and later narrative skill would differ between populations in theoretically meaningful ways. For children with brain injuries, I predicted character viewpoint gesture would play a particularly crucial role in supporting the development of complex narrative skills, potentially serving as a key compensatory mechanism for narrative development in this population. This prediction was supported by evidence that gesture can serve both diagnostic and facilitative functions in language development [@goldin-meadowGestureWindowCommunicative2015].
